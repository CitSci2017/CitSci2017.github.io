				<p style="width: 65%">This paper will show if/how Myers-Briggs personality traits are associated with neuroplasticity.</p>
				<p style="width: 65%">The Myers-Briggs personality test is a straightforward, well-known way to categorize different personality traits. Different personality types may respond differently to positive or negative reinforcement.</p>
				<p style="width: 65%">The important aspects of personality to test here are thinking vs. feeling, judgement vs. perception, and sensing vs. intuition.</p>
				<p style="width: 65%">Introversion vs. extroversion did not seem to be as important to study here, since the aim of this experiment would be less on how people interact with their environment and more on how people learn.</p>
				<p style="width: 65%">This experiment is more concerned with how different personality types face learning and adaptation.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="tab-pane" id="relevance" style="margin-top: 2%">
				<p style="width: 65%">This is experiment test how different Myers-Briggs personality types learn.</p>
				<p style="width: 65%">The results of this experiment could potentially impact the way people learn in their own lives.</p>
				<p style="width: 65%">These results could have potential applications in education.</p>
				<p style="width: 65%">By indicating which types of people learn faster under which types reinforcement we can figure out how different people learn best.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="tab-pane" id="hypothesis" style="margin-top: 2%">
				<p style="width: 65%">If the subjects have Myers-Briggs personality types include sensing, judging and/or thinking, then they will have no difference between the positive and negative reinforcements or no reinforcement at all.</p>
				<p style="width: 65%">If the subjects have the personality types intuition, feeling, and/or perception, then they will have correlation with reinforcements.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="tab-pane" id="protocol" style="margin-top: 2%">
				<ul style="width: 65%">
					<li>Collect a group of subjects that equally represent the Myers-Briggs personality types</li>
					<li>Have the subjects attempt to throw a beanbag into a bucket 3 yards away until they make it in 3 consecutive times</li>
					<li>Divide the subjects randomly into four groups.</li>
					<li>Group A will attempt to throw the beanbags into the basket 3 consecutive times with the prism glasses on. Each subject will be randomly assigned the direction and degree of calibration of the prism glasses. This is the control group.</li>
					<li>Group B will attempt to throw the beanbags into the basket 3 consecutive times wearing the prism glasses, but each time they miss, an audio recording will be played. The audio recordings will be of an authoritative and degrading voice saying taunting or degrading phrases (e.g. “What are you doing!”, “Wow. That was a fail.”). Each subject will be randomly assigned the direction and degree of calibration of the prism glasses. They will be testing negative reinforcement.</li>
					<li>Group C will attempt to throw the beanbags into the basket 3 consecutive times wearing the prism glasses, but each time they miss, an audio recording will be played. The audio recording will be of a friendly voice saying positive, uplifting phrases (e.g. “You’re so good at this!”, “I’m proud of you!”, “You rock.”). Each subject will be randomly assigned the direction and degree of calibration of the prism glasses. This group will test positive reinforcement.</li>
					<li>Group D will be testing the combination of both negative AND positive reinforcement. Each subject will be randomly assigned the direction and degree of calibration of the prism glasses. If the subject misses, a recording of an authoritative voice saying a degrading phrase will be played, and if the subject makes it in, a friendly and supportive phrase will be played.</li>
					<li>The researchers observing the experiment should not be told which Myers-Briggs personality type the subject is. This will help prevent bias in the data recording.</li>

				<p style="width: 65%">Subjects that are more affected by facts and logic may perform better under circumstances in which negative enforcement is used than subjects more affected by feeling.</p>
				<p style="width: 65%">The audio recordings may not affect the thinkers as much because they can more easily ignore the negative remarks and focus on their performance. The feelers may be affected negatively by the negative remarks and perform more poorly, because they will allow the recordings to influence their subconscious. However, the feelers may perform better than the thinkers in instances where positive reinforcement is used. The positive reinforcement will affect their effort as they learn to adapt to the glasses. The thinkers, again, will be objective and be less affected by the recordings of the remarks. Where both positive and negative reinforcement are used, the thinkers may perform more consistently than the feelers.</p>
				<p style="width: 65%">In terms of the perceiving personality types, those who tend to sense information by looking at the facts and data presented will be less affected by the negative reinforcement. They will ignore the biased opinions of the recordings and focus more on the raw data they receive as to whether they made it in or not.</p>
				<p style="width: 65%">Those who rely on intuition may be negatively affected by these remarks. The recordings may affect their subconscious to the point where they begin to believe the negative remarks. They would thrive under positive reinforcement because their subconscious would absorb the positive remarks and they will perform better.</p>
				<p style="width: 65%">There would be no difference in the positive and negative reinforcement for those who rely on sensory information. They would also not face any change when listening to both positive and negative reinforcement.</p>
				<p style="width: 65%">Subjects which rely more on their judging attribute will be less affected by the negative reinforcement. They will learn best by ignoring the recordings and focusing more on what progress they have made. Those who are more of attuned to their perception will have a more difficult time with the negative reinforcement. Since the negative remarks are part of their environment, they will absorb them and become discouraged quickly.</p>
				<p style="width: 65%">In terms of positive reinforcement, those who are more judgmental will have little change and their results. They will be less likely to take the recordings into consideration during the experiment, thus their results will have little difference from the negative remarks.</p>
				<p style="width: 65%">Those who are more perceptive we'll see the positive remarks as part of their environment and thus become more encouraged and perform better. When the subjects are faced with both positive and negative reinforcement, the perceptive types will have more scattered results since event will take the remarks into consideration subconsciously during the trial.
